# Death2Death to VISUALG

Hi user! This is a small guide to a game made entirely by me in a program called "Visualg". This is a Portuguese pseudocode, with scarce tools and used only for basic education. My intention with this project was to take my creativity and my ability to produce something minimally large with an extremely basic and "weird" tool!


First, I ask you to read the game guide for Ruby, as that is a complete game guide. Here I will just list the version differences.

1 - There is no way to quit the game with the "quit" command

2 - There is no life in this game (causing the character not to die). Instead, the game uses "Glory Points" as something that decreases as you take damage.

3 - It is not possible to run the game anywhere other than the visualg itself. As this program serves only to help students understand the logic of programming, it is not supported for more ambitious productions. Therefore, the execution must be done by opening the txt file inside the "VISUALG" program and executing the code with F9

4 - The final animation is a little different from the final Ruby version.


Thanks!
